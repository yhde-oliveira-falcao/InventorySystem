# InventorySystem
This code is a simplified version of a Inventory Management and Reporting system made for a client. It is based on NodeJS, Handlebars and MongoDB.

It works by enabling the employees to login and input the end-of-the-day inventory into a responsive page. 
The data is stored in a database along with the employee info, and a SMS message is sent by the server to the regional manager of the restaurant.

Managers can add, edit or delete inventory information as well as user's information.

Authentication is NOT up to date and 2 factor authentication was implemented to the client.
